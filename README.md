## About

This is a sample Android application built with **Jetpack Compose**, showcasing a custom **MVI**
architecture and modern Android development practices.

The app integrates with the [Rick and Morty API](https://rickandmortyapi.com/) and provides
multiple screens with paginated data and detailed content views.

The project serves as a practical example for building Android applications using
**Jetpack Compose** and **MVI** architecture. It demonstrates how to structure a multimodular
codebase, apply **Clean Architecture**, integrate with a public API, handle pagination and maintain
code quality with static analysis, testing and **CI** tools. Feel free to explore and use!
